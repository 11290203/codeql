### Breaking Changes

* CodeQL package management is now generally available, and all GitHub-produced CodeQL packages have had their version numbers increased to 1.0.0.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* JDK version detection based on Gradle projects has been improved. Java extraction using build-modes `autobuild` or `none` is more likely to pick an appropriate JDK version, particularly when the Android Gradle Plugin or Spring Boot Plugin are in use.
