## 1.0.0

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The "Use of unique pointer after lifetime ends" query (`cpp/use-of-unique-pointer-after-lifetime-ends`) no longer reports an alert when the pointer is converted to a boolean
* The "Variable not initialized before use" query (`cpp/not-initialised`) no longer reports an alert on static variables.
